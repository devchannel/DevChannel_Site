                        Some of the things you'll find in DevChannel:</p> <!-- When you type it as DevChannel it looks like a term rather than the word Channel, so putting an article in there seems a bit off place, like you wouldn't say I play the counter strike, or I know the C++ etc, when it's a name "the" doesn't sound right, if you insist though then it's not as big of a problem cause after a bit one can quickly realize why the article is there.-->

                         Well, I have, and as a result I posted <a class="link" href="https://redd.it/3mig3t"> a thread on reddit</a> a while back.
                         I expected like 1 or 2 replies from some other lonely beginners, but instead I got a lot more and someone suggested that I create a Slack team, which is what I did.
                         From a community of about 40 people we started DevChannel, which now has almost 400 members!
